abstract = {The vertex coloring problem is a classical problem in combinatorial optimization that consists of assigning a color to each vertex of a graph such that no adjacent vertices share the same color, minimizing the number of colors used. Despite the various practical applications that exist for this problem, its NP-hardness still represents a computational challenge. Some of the best computational results obtained for this problem are consequences of hybridizing the various known heuristics. Automatically revising the space constituted by combining these techniques to find the most adequate combination has received less attention. In this paper, we propose exploring the heuristics space for the vertex coloring problem using evolutionary algorithms. We automatically generate three new algorithms by combining elementary heuristics. To evaluate the new algorithms, a computational experiment was performed that allowed comparing them numerically with existing heuristics. The obtained algorithms present an average 29.97\% relative error, while four other heuristics selected from the literature present a 59.73\% error, considering 29 of the more difficult instances in the DIMACS benchmark.},

abstract = {Genetic algorithms are powerful search methods inspired by Darwinian evolution. To date, they have been applied to the solution of many optimization problems because of the easy use of their properties and their robustness in finding good solutions to difficult problems. The good operation of genetic algorithms is due in part to its two main variation operators, namely, crossover and mutation operators. Typically, in the literature, we find the use of a single crossover and mutation operator. However, there are studies that have shown that using multi-operators produces synergy and that the operators are mutually complementary. Using multi-operators is not a simple task because which operators to use and how to combine them must be determined, which in itself is an optimization problem. In this paper, it is proposed that the task of exploring the different combinations of the crossover and mutation operators can be carried out by evolutionary computing. The crossover and mutation operators used are those typically used for solving the traveling salesman problem. The process of searching for good combinations was effective, yielding appropriate and synergic combinations of the crossover and mutation operators. The numerical results show that the use of the combination of operators obtained by evolutionary computing is better than the use of a single operator and the use of multi-operators combined in the standard way. The results were also better than those of the last operators reported in the literature.},

abstract="Waste collection is one of the most critical logistics activities in modern cities with considerable impact on the quality of life, urban environment, city attractiveness, traffic flows and municipal budgets. Despite the problem's relevance, most existing work addresses simplified versions where container loads are considered to be known in advance and served by a single vehicle depot. Waste levels, however, cannot be estimated with complete certainty as they are only revealed at collection. Furthermore, in large cities and clustered urban areas, multiple depots from which collection routes originate are common, although cooperation among vehicles from different depots is rarely considered. This paper analyses a rich version of the waste collection problem with multiple depots and stochastic demands by proposing a hybrid algorithm combining metaheuristics with simulation. Our `simheuristic' approach allows for studying the effects of cooperation among different depots, thus quantifying the potential savings this cooperation could provide to city governments and waste collection companies.",

@article{Contreras20b,
abstract = {The Traveling Salesman Problem with Time-dependent Service times (TSP-TS) is a generalization of the Asymmetric TSP, in which the service time at each customer is given by a (linear or quadratic) function of the corresponding start time of service. TSP-TS calls for determining a Hamiltonian tour (i.e. a tour visiting each customer exactly once) that minimizes the total tour duration, given by the sum of travel and service times. We propose a new Mixed Integer Programming model for TSP-TS, that is enhanced by lower and upper bounds that improve previous bounds from the literature, and by incorporating exponentially many subtour elimination constraints, that are separated in a dynamic way. In addition, we develop a multi-operator genetic algorithm and two Branch-and-Cut methods, based on the proposed model. The algorithms are tested on benchmark symmetric instances from the literature, and compared with an existing approach. The computational results show that the proposed exact methods are able to prove the optimality of the solutions found for a larger set of instances in shorter computing times. We also tested the Branch-and-Cut algorithms on larger size symmetric instances with up to 58 nodes and on asymmetric instances with up to 45 nodes, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. In addition, we tested the genetic algorithm on symmetric and asymmetric instances with up to 200 nodes.},
